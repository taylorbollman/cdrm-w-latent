# Workspace

Use `/home/taylorbollman/cdrm-w-latent` as the active project. The old projects
are unrelated archives and must not be searched unless explicitly requested.
Do not print credentials or environment-file values.

# Container execution

Never run CUDA, training, GPU evaluation or profiling in the host shell and
never silently fall back to CPU. Bootstrap GPU instances with
`bash /home/taylorbollman/start.sh`; CPU instances with Local SSD use
`bash /home/taylorbollman/start_cpu.sh`.

After bootstrap, use `bash /home/taylorbollman/cdrm-w-latent/scripts/docker_shell.sh`.
For a single command, append `bash -lc '<command>'`. The container working
directory must be `/workspace/cdrm-w-latent`. Before GPU work, verify that the
command is inside the container and that `nvidia-smi` succeeds there.
Use `CDRM_DOCKER_GPUS=none` explicitly for CPU container work.

Add dependencies to `docker/requirements-docker.txt` and rebuild with
`scripts/docker_build.sh`. Keep `.env` and `.docker-home` out of Git.
